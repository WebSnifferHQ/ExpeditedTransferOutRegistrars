A list of domain registrars that allow expedited transfers out of domain names.

## Sav

Once you receive an email from Sav with the subject "Domain Transfer Out Started", go to the domain details of the domain in question in your Sav "My Domains" panel and click the "Approve" link near the "Pending Transfer" status of the domain. Sav has a support article called [Transferring a Domain Away from Sav](https://help.sav.com/hc/en-us/articles/11932938198171-Transferring-a-Domain-Away-from-Sav), but it doesn't mention the option to expedite a domain transfer.
