To immediately approve the transfer, click the "Approve" button. To reject the transfer, click the "Reject" button.

## Dynadot

After you've initiated a domain transfer with the receiving registrar, Dynadot will send you an email with the subject "Transfer Away (order ########)." The email will contain the following text:

```
Hey [username],

Today, we received notification that you’d like to transfer example.com to another domain name registrar: [receiving registrar].

Please use the following button to AUTHORIZE or CANCEL the domain transfer within five (5) days of this message:

https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/transfer/out.html

NOTE: If you don’t respond, the transfer will automatically be approved after five (5) days, and the domain will go to the new registrar.

If you didn’t request the transfer away of this domain, please let us know at info at dynadot dot com.

All the best,  
Dynadot
```

To approve the transfer, simply follow the link in the email: [https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/transfer/out.html](https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/transfer/out.html). This will take you to the "Transfer Out Domains" page.

It may take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours to receive an email from Spaceship with the subject "Confirmation of Registrar Transfer Request." You will receive one such email for each domain being transferred out.

Once you've received the email, log into your Spaceship account and navigate to the "Domain List" section. Domains pending transfer will be marked with a "Transferring out" tag. Click on the domain, and in the "Transfer in Progress" window, you will see two options: "Cancel Transfer" and "Speed Up Transfer." Choose the "Speed Up Transfer" option. The domain will then be immediately removed from your domain list at Spaceship.
