# Expedited Transfer Out Registrars

A list of domain name registrars with the capability to expedite outbound domain transfers. 

A domain name transfer from one registrar to another can take about 5-7 days to complete. Some registrars allow to expedite the transfer so the domain name transfers within a matter of hours instead of days by following some steps. Below is the list of such registrars as well as the description of the steps that you need to take.

## Dynadot

After you've initiated a domain transfer with the receiving registrar, Dynadot will send you an email with the subject "Transfer Away (order ########)". The email will consist the following text:

```
Hey Dynadot Privacy Service,

Today, we received notification that you’d like to transfer example.com to another domain name registrar : [receiving registrar].

Please use the following button to AUTHORIZE or CANCEL the domain transfer within five (5) days of this message:

https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/transfer/out.html

NOTE: If you don’t respond, the transfer will automatically be approved after five (5) days, and the domain will go to the new registrar.

If you didn’t request the transfer away of this domain, please let us know at info at dynadot dot com.

All the best,
Dynadot
```

Just follow the link from the email: https://www.dynadot.com/account/domain/transfer/out.html. The "Transfer Out Domains" page will open.

The "Order Status" of the domain will be indicated as "Processing. Requires Acknowledgement For The Transfer Request". In the "Allow" column for the domain in question there will be two options: Yes and No. Just click the button with the "Yes" option. Afterwards you should breifly see the message "Transfer has been accepted", what means that your transfer approval has been successful.
